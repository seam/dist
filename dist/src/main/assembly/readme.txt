Seam ${project.version}
==========================

Seam is a set of portable extensions for Java EE based on CDI (JSR-299 Contexts and Dependency Injection).
It integrates a number of technologies in a unified stack, and provides numerous features useful for 
building modern, enterprise-grade applications.  It has been designed from the ground up to eliminate
complexity at both the architecture and API levels, and allows developers to assemble complex web
applications using simple annotated Java classes and minimal XML.  It provides support for numerous view 
technologies such as JSF, GWT and Wicket, and comes with powerful tooling (Seam Forge), with rapid 
application development features to allow you to get up and running in a minimal amount of time.
